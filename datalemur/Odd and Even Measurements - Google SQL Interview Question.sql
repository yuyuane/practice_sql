# This is the same question as problem #28 in the SQL Chapter of Ace the Data Science Interview!
#
# Assume you're given a table with measurement values obtained from a Google sensor over multiple days with measurements taken multiple times within each day.
#
# Write a query to calculate the sum of odd-numbered and even-numbered measurements separately for a particular day and display the results in two different columns. Refer to the Example Output below for the desired format.
#
# Definition:
#
# Within a day, measurements taken at 1st, 3rd, and 5th times are considered odd-numbered measurements, and measurements taken at 2nd, 4th, and 6th times are considered even-numbered measurements.
# Effective April 15th, 2023, the question and solution for this question have been revised.
#
# measurements Table:
# Column Name	Type
# measurement_id	integer
# measurement_value	decimal
# measurement_time	datetime
# measurements Example Input:
# measurement_id	measurement_value	measurement_time
# 131233	1109.51	07/10/2022 09:00:00
# 135211	1662.74	07/10/2022 11:00:00
# 523542	1246.24	07/10/2022 13:15:00
# 143562	1124.50	07/11/2022 15:00:00
# 346462	1234.14	07/11/2022 16:45:00
# Example Output:
# measurement_day	odd_sum	even_sum
# 07/10/2022 00:00:00	2355.75	1662.74
# 07/11/2022 00:00:00	1124.50	1234.14
# Explanation
# Based on the results,
#
# On 07/10/2022, the sum of the odd-numbered measurements is 2355.75, while the sum of the even-numbered measurements is 1662.74.
# On 07/11/2022, there are only two measurements available. The sum of the odd-numbered measurements is 1124.50, and the sum of the even-numbered measurements is 1234.14.
# The dataset you are querying against may have different input & output - this is just an example!
