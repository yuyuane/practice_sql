# Effective April 3rd 2024, we have updated the problem statement to provide additional clarity.
#
# Amazon wants to maximize the storage capacity of its 500,000 square-foot warehouse by prioritizing a specific batch of prime items. The specific prime product batch detailed in the inventory table must be maintained.
#
# So, if the prime product batch specified in the item_category column included 1 laptop and 1 side table, that would be the base batch. We could not add another laptop without also adding a side table; they come all together as a batch set.
#
# After prioritizing the maximum number of prime batches, any remaining square footage will be utilized to stock non-prime batches, which also come in batch sets and cannot be separated into individual items.
#
# Write a query to find the maximum number of prime and non-prime batches that can be stored in the 500,000 square feet warehouse based on the following criteria:
#
# Prioritize stocking prime batches
# After accommodating prime items, allocate any remaining space to non-prime batches
# Output the item_type with prime_eligible first followed by not_prime, along with the maximum number of batches that can be stocked.
#
# Assumptions:
#
# Again, products must be stocked in batches, so we want to find the largest available quantity of prime batches, and then the largest available quantity of non-prime batches
# Non-prime items must always be available in stock to meet customer demand, so the non-prime item count should never be zero.
# Item count should be whole numbers (integers).
# inventory table:
# Column Name	Type
# item_id	integer
# item_type	string
# item_category	string
# square_footage	decimal
# inventory Example Input:
# item_id	item_type	item_category	square_footage
# 1374	prime_eligible	mini refrigerator	68.00
# 4245	not_prime	standing lamp	26.40
# 2452	prime_eligible	television	85.00
# 3255	not_prime	side table	22.60
# 1672	prime_eligible	laptop	8.50
# Example Output:
# item_type	item_count
# prime_eligible	9285
# not_prime	6
# The dataset you are querying against may have different input & output - this is just an example!
