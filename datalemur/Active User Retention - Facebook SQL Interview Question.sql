# This is the same question as problem #23 in the SQL Chapter of Ace the Data Science Interview!
#
# Assume you're given a table containing information on Facebook user actions. Write a query to obtain number of monthly active users (MAUs) in July 2022, including the month in numerical format "1, 2, 3".
#
# Hint:
#
# An active user is defined as a user who has performed actions such as 'sign-in', 'like', or 'comment' in both the current month and the previous month.
# user_actions Table:
# Column Name	Type
# user_id	integer
# event_id	integer
# event_type	string ("sign-in, "like", "comment")
# event_date	datetime
# user_actionsExample Input:
# user_id	event_id	event_type	event_date
# 445	7765	sign-in	05/31/2022 12:00:00
# 742	6458	sign-in	06/03/2022 12:00:00
# 445	3634	like	06/05/2022 12:00:00
# 742	1374	comment	06/05/2022 12:00:00
# 648	3124	like	06/18/2022 12:00:00
# Example Output for June 2022:
# month	monthly_active_users
# 6	1
# Example
# In June 2022, there was only one monthly active user (MAU) with the user_id 445.
#
# Please note that the output provided is for June 2022 as the user_actions table only contains event dates for that month. You should adapt the solution accordingly for July 2022.
#
# The dataset you are querying against may have different input & output - this is just an example!

with n as (
    select
        user_id,

      and EXTRACT(month from event_date) in (6,7) group by user_id
