# Amazon Web Services (AWS) is powered by fleets of servers. Senior management has requested data-driven solutions to optimize server usage.
#
# Write a query that calculates the total time that the fleet of servers was running. The output should be in units of full days.
#
# Assumptions:
#
# Each server might start and stop several times.
# The total time in which the server fleet is running can be calculated as the sum of each server's uptime.
# server_utilization Table:
# Column Name	Type
# server_id	integer
# status_time	timestamp
# session_status	string
# server_utilization Example Input:
# server_id	status_time	session_status
# 1	08/02/2022 10:00:00	start
# 1	08/04/2022 10:00:00	stop
# 2	08/17/2022 10:00:00	start
# 2	08/24/2022 10:00:00	stop
# Example Output:
# total_uptime_days
# 21
# Explanation
# In the example output, the combined uptime of all the servers (from each start time to stop time) totals 21 full days.
#
# The dataset you are querying against may have different input & output - this is just an example!
