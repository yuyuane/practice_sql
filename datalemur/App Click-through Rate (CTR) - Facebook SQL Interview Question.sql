# `This is the same question as problem #1 in the SQL Chapter of Ace the Data Science Interview!
#
# Assume you have an events table on Facebook app analytics. Write a query to calculate the click-through rate (CTR) for the app in 2022 and round the results to 2 decimal places.
#
# Definition and note:
#
# Percentage of click-through rate (CTR) = 100.0 * Number of clicks / Number of impressions
# To avoid integer division, multiply the CTR by 100.0, not 100.
# events Table:
# Column Name	Type
# app_id	integer
# event_type	string
# timestamp	datetime
# events Example Input:
# app_id	event_type	timestamp
# 123	impression	07/18/2022 11:36:12
# 123	impression	07/18/2022 11:37:12
# 123	click	07/18/2022 11:37:42
# 234	impression	07/18/2022 14:15:12
# 234	click	07/18/2022 14:16:12
# Example Output:
# app_id	ctr
# 123	50.00
# 234	100.00
# Explanation
# Let's consider an example of App 123. This app has a click-through rate (CTR) of 50.00% because out of the 2 impressions it received, it got 1 click.
#
# To calculate the CTR, we divide the number of clicks by the number of impressions, and then multiply the result by 100.0 to express it as a percentage. In this case, 1 divided by 2 equals 0.5, and when multiplied by 100.0, it becomes 50.00%. So, the CTR of App 123 is 50.00%.
#
# The dataset you are querying against may have different input & output - this is just an example!`
