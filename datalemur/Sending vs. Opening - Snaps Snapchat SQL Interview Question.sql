# This is the same question as problem #25 in the SQL Chapter of Ace the Data Science Interview!
#
# Assume you're given tables with information on Snapchat users, including their ages and time spent sending and opening snaps.
#
# Write a query to obtain a breakdown of the time spent sending vs. opening snaps as a percentage of total time spent on these activities grouped by age group. Round the percentage to 2 decimal places in the output.
#
# Notes:
#
# Calculate the following percentages:
# time spent sending / (Time spent sending + Time spent opening)
# Time spent opening / (Time spent sending + Time spent opening)
# To avoid integer division in percentages, multiply by 100.0 and not 100.
# Effective April 15th, 2023, the solution has been updated and optimised.

# age_breakdown Table
# Column Name	Type

# age_breakdown Example Input
# user_id	age_bucket
# 123	31-35
# 456	26-30
# 789	21-25
# Example Output
# age_bucket	send_perc	open_perc
# 26-30	65.40	34.60
# 31-35	43.75	56.25
# Explanation
# Using the age bucket 26-30 as example, the time spent sending snaps was 5.67 and the time spent opening snaps was 3.
#
# To calculate the percentage of time spent sending snaps, we divide the time spent sending snaps by the total time spent on sending and opening snaps, which is 5.67 + 3 = 8.67.
#
# So, the percentage of time spent sending snaps is 5.67 / (5.67 + 3) = 65.4%, and the percentage of time spent opening snaps is 3 / (5.67 + 3) = 34.6%.
#
# The dataset you are querying against may have different input & output - this is just an example!
